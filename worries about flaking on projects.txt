I'm worried that I'll flake on this project. I feel like I flake on a lot of things. For example, I don't think I've been the strongest at completing my projects in the past such as the pcb designs and what not. Who knows, maybe if I post them all to youtube, it'll encourage me to continue since there's that pressure of an audience watching that'll push me to continue to work and upload more stuff. I don't know the specifics of it all but I think that's a general theory. I don't know what the best plan for me to continue is but I think that I'm generally going ok right now. I don't feel like I'm going as fast as I'd need to for the classes I'm going to be taking but oh well, we'll have to see when I get there. Until then, I'm going to be chilling with what I'm doing now and that's fine. I should work out more now though. Working out is nice and I should do more of that. It'll be a good chance for me to just be more happy with my body and just enjoy what I'm able to do. I may not be the best at a lot of things but at least I can do things and that's something that I take for granted all the time. I don't think I'm the best for making videos, I don't think I'm the best for coding or making circuits but what do I really have to lose for doing all that. I can only have upsides if I do all that stuff. Maybe I'd be able to make a video on the jetbot project and upload it to Youtube for stuff. I don't know what my future plan is but I know that I'm chilling and I just need to push myself further with all these projects.
