If you could detect objects by sight, what would you do with that information? I think the biggest thing would be to compare those two objects. To say which one is bigger and then go through and see which one is heavier or something. I'm not too sure. I think the size idea would be quite interesting though. Not only seeing what those two objects look like but also determining which of the two is bigger and maybe determining the size of the objects from this calculation. It might be something doable but it sounds like it'd be a lot of work and I'm not too sure if it's that good of an idea. It seems like stuff made here did a similar thing with his camera of just knowing the place of objects and just determining their shape but it can be kind of hard to do that. 
What else would you do if you could look at two objects only. You could determine color? Say which one is closer to the bright red that you'd want and go to that one? I feel like the concern with that project would be what would happen if that brighter object were to move after it was first placed and the computer would get confused? Not too sure yet.
